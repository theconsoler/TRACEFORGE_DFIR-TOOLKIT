# 🔍 TRACE FORGE
### Digital Forensics & Incident Response Toolkit

---

## 📘 Overview
TRACE FORGE is a modular **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** toolkit designed to simplify the process of analyzing multiple types of forensic evidence including memory dumps, disk images, log files, and network captures in all under one unified interface.

This project was built as part of my cybersecurity research to demonstrate an end-to-end incident response framework capable of rapid artifact collection, analysis, and case reporting.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Develop modular forensic components for memory, disk, log, and network analysis.  
- Implement automated metadata generation (hashes, timestamps) for evidence integrity.  
- Build a unified CLI that auto-discovers available modules.  
- Ensure extensibility for plugin-based future modules.  
- Maintain accuracy, transparency, and usability for investigators.

## ❓ Why TRACE FORGE?
During real-world incident response, analysts often rely on multiple separate tools to gather and analyze evidence.  
TRACE FORGE aims to bring these capabilities together into **one streamlined and extensible toolkit**, built in Python, where every analysis result is automatically hashed, logged, and stored for proper chain-of-custody tracking.

## 🧱 Current Project Phases

### **Phase 1 – Planning and Design**
In this phase, I defined:
- The scope and objectives of the toolkit.  
- The core architecture for a modular DFIR tool.  
- The initial folder structure and technology stack (Python 3, Volatility3, pytsk3, Scapy, SQLite).  
- A high-level workflow diagram describing data flow between modules.

---

### **Phase 2 – Framework Skeleton and Architecture**
In this phase, I structured the entire toolkit by setting up its module placeholders, creating the base folder layout, and developing the initial CLI menu system.

The focus of Phase 2 was on environment setup, CLI integration, and ensuring all dependencies were installed correctly before module implementation.


**Key Achievements:**
- Created the full directory hierarchy under `/traceforge/`.  
- Added base Python module skeletons (`memory.py`, `disk.py`, `logs.py`, `network.py`, `report.py`).  
- Developed the initial interactive CLI (`cli.py`).  
- Locked dependencies using `requirements.txt`.  
- Documented environment setup and testing in `/docs/Phase2_Architecture.md`.
