# 🔍 TRACE FORGE
### Digital Forensics & Incident Response Toolkit

---

## 📘 Overview
TRACE FORGE is a modular **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** toolkit designed to simplify the process of analyzing multiple types of forensic evidence — including memory dumps, disk images, log files, and network captures — all under one unified interface.

This project was built as part of my cybersecurity research to demonstrate an end-to-end incident response framework capable of rapid artifact collection, analysis, and case reporting.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Develop modular forensic components for memory, disk, log, and network analysis.  
- Implement automated metadata generation (hashes, timestamps) for evidence integrity.  
- Build a unified CLI that auto-discovers available modules.  
- Ensure extensibility for plugin-based future modules.  
- Maintain accuracy, transparency, and usability for investigators.

## ❓ Why TRACE FORGE?
During real-world incident response, analysts often have to rely on multiple separate tools to gather and analyze evidence.  
TRACE FORGE aims to bring these capabilities together into **one streamlined and extensible toolkit**, built in Python, where every analysis result is automatically hashed, logged, and stored for proper chain-of-custody tracking.

## 🧱 Current Project Phase
**Phase 1 – Planning and Design**

In this phase, I defined:
- The **scope and objectives** of the toolkit.  
- The **core architecture** for a modular DFIR tool.  
- The **initial folder structure** and technology stack (Python 3, Volatility3, pytsk3, Scapy, SQLite).  
- A **high-level workflow diagram** describing data flow between modules.

Future phases will cover:
- **Phase 2:** Building the skeleton and architecture.  
- **Phase 3:** Implementation and testing.  
- **Phase 4:** Optimization and hardening.
